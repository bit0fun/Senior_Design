# University of Rochester Senior Design Project: Low Power Server
####We have designed and assessed the feasibility of a low power server that can display a website page within minimal latency (1-10 seconds) of a standard web server. Due to the complexity and time constraints, we have created designs for the motherboard, and toolchain for the custom processor. The motherboard is ready to be sent for first prototypes, and the assembler and linker function flawlessly. The simulator runs Fusion-Core executable ELF files, with a proper memory view and register dump of the running program.
